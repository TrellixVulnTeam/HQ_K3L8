    <h2> What is HQ? </h2>
    <p>HQ stands for headquarters - Literally a place for your mind.  My
       philsophy is that good organization and planning are the keys to
       accomplishing all of your goals. HQ is a tool I created to help
       myself track all my projects and crush goals. Sick of looking at
       excel sheets and having lists scattered in different areas, I needed
       something to manage these lists for me without wasting my own time
       just getting organized. With varying interests, I needed a tool to
       help me focus on the right things at the right time in order
       to acheive all my goals.

    <h2> What does HQ run on? </h2>
    <p> HQ is written in python on a web framework called Django. The backend
        is a MySQL database. I am a self-learner without any programming background
        and built this from watching youtube videos and reading online documentation.
        This would not be possible without the help of many users on stack overflow
        and the excellent documentation from the Django team. </p>

    <p> Getting feedback from friends and family first, but I'll make improvements
         in small batches over time. Check out the HQ project list <a href="#"> here </a> </p>
